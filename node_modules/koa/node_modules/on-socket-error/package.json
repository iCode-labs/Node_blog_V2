Specifically, this is when the client aborts a request. You want to destroy any file streams you create on socket errors otherwise you will leak file descriptors.\n\nNode / Connect / Express:\n\n```js\nvar onSocketError = require('on-socket-error')\n\nfunction (req, res, next) {\n  var stream = fs.createReadStream('thingie.json')\n  stream.pipe(res)\n  onSocketError(res, function () {\n    stream.destroy()\n  })\n}\n```\n\nKoa:\n\n```js\nfunction* () {\n  var stream = this.body = fs.createReadStream('thingie.json')\n  onSocketError(this, function () {\n    stream.destroy()\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jonathan Ong me@jongleberry.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
